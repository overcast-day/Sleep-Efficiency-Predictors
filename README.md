# Predicting Sleep Efficiency

Sleep is an essential aspect of human life, and its quality significantly impacts our overall health and well-being. However, many people struggle with getting good quality sleep, which can lead to various adverse health outcomes. To address this issue, we have undertaken a project to predict sleep efficiency using statistical analysis and logistic regression models.
In this project, we aim to develop a model that can accurately predict the quality of sleep based on various factors, such as the duration of sleep, caffeine consumption, deep sleep percentage, and light sleep percentage. By predicting sleep efficiency, we can identify potential causes of poor sleep and provide recommendations to improve it. To achieve this goal, we will collect data from Kaggle and analyze the data to identify patterns and trends associated with sleep efficiency. Finally, we will develop a model to predict sleep efficiency based on these factors. We attempt to use either a linear model or a quadratic model, whichever is more suitable and gives us better results to approach this. The motivation behind this project is that sleep is essential for many college students. Many choose to ignore sleep and rely on caffeine consumption to function. We want to determine if any relationships exist between items like Coffee, Cigarettes, Alcohol, or sleep patterns and sleep efficiency. It has been repeatedly proved that sleep deprivation leads to a reduction in alertness, attention, and other basic cognitive processes (García et al., 2021). “Sleep deprivation is more detrimental to cognitive functions that depend more on mental effort and cognitive capacity,” such as reaction time (Kusztor et al., 2019). Sleep is an essential aspect for humans, and thus we want to explore how to maximize its efficiency and determine if any factors are more detrimental to it.
The potential benefits of this project are important, as improving sleep efficiency can positively impact many areas of people’s lives. We hope that this research will lead to a better understanding of sleep and its relationship with various lifestyle factors and ultimately contribute to the development of more effective interventions to improve sleep quality.
